# TrackLab SoccerNet config

# The defaults list contains the files that will be used
# to create the final config file. This item *must* be
# the first element in the file.
# Detailed configs for each default component below are located in "sn-gamestate/sn-gamestate/configs" and "tracklab/tracklab/configs"
# Define here which implementation (yolov8, oc_sort, ..) to use for each generic (detection, tracking, ...) component.
defaults:
  - override /dataset: soccernet_gs
  - override /eval: trackeval
  - override /engine: offline
  - override /state: save  # Dump tracking results to a .pcklz file to save computation time on the next run. Have a look at TrackLab tutorials for more details.
  - override /visualization: gamestate  # Save tracking results as a .mp4 video in the run directory specified below (sn-gamestate/outputs/...)
  - override /modules/bbox_detector: yolov8
  - override /modules/reid: prtreid
  - override /modules/track: oc_sort
  - override /modules/pitch : tvcalib
  - override /modules/calibration: tvcalib
  - override /modules/jersey_number_detect: mmocr
  - override /modules/team: kmeans_embeddings
  - override /modules/team_side: mean_position
  - override /modules/tracklet_agg: voting_role_jn
  - _self_

# Pipeline definition :
# - Defines the order in which the modules will be called
# - If loading a tracking state from disk, remove modules whose outputs are already provided in the loaded state
# Use 'pipeline: []' for an empty pipeline (e.g. when loading all tracking results from a saved .pklz tracker state)
pipeline:
  - reid
  - track
  - team
  - team_side
